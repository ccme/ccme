# CCME Platform Overview

## Summary

The **CCME Platform** is a private-first communication and media sharing system designed for teams, companies, and organizations. Unlike public social networks, CCME ensures that posts, videos, and conversations stay within your trusted network.

At the heart of the platform are three key ideas:

1. **Pulse** – capture quick updates (video shorts, images, or text).
2. **CCME Server** – keep posts private by default, while allowing controlled sharing to teams or individuals.
3. **Stethoscope** – a TikTok-like feed where users can review, acknowledge, and respond to posts quickly.

To make the experience more intelligent, **Ozwell** can be invited to your CCME account to prioritize and organize your feed according to your own rules—not an algorithm you can’t control.

The result: **people send you posts, Ozwell sorts them, and you review, acknowledge, and respond in an efficient, private-first environment.**

## Components

### 1. **Pulse (Camera Capture)**

* A multi-platform app for capturing **short video clips** (under 3 minutes preferred), images, or text posts.
* Posts can be created anywhere and uploaded to any CCME server.
* Example: `pulse.ccme.com` provides a public instance for testing.
* Designed for speed and simplicity, like sending a quick “pulse check” to your team.

### 2. **CCME Server**

* An **open-source, private server** that stores posts securely.
* Keeps all posts **private by default**, with controlled sharing to:

  * Individuals
  * Teams
  * Leadership hierarchies (manager → director → CEO, etc.)
* Handles tags to organize posts by **person, project, patient, or team**.
* Supports **threads**: replies turn a post into a threaded discussion.
* Threads can evolve into **topics**, which can be shared more broadly.
* Includes a built-in **web viewer version of Stethoscope** so nothing needs to be installed.

### 3. **Stethoscope (Feed Browser)**

* A **TikTok-like app** for flicking through posts in an infinite scroll or full-screen view.
* Designed for rapid review of updates with simple actions:

  * **Acknowledge** a post (like signing off on an action item).
  * **Comment** with text, images, or your own short video.
  * **Reply** to start a thread or escalate a topic.
* Keeps track of what you’ve seen and ensures authors know their post has been viewed.

### 4. **Ozwell (Feed Prioritization)**

* An optional AI assistant that can be invited to your CCME account.
* Helps you **design your own feed policy**:

  * Decide what posts should surface first.
  * Prioritize based on team, projects, urgency, or leadership directives.
* Unlike traditional social media, your feed is under **your control**, not dictated by hidden algorithms.

## Use Cases

### 1. **Company Check-Ins**

* Employees capture daily updates via Pulse.
* Posts are tagged with **project names** and **leaders**.
* Leaders review and escalate posts up the hierarchy.
* CEOs can share key updates with the entire organization.
* Tagging rules ensure only authorized people can share with wider groups.

### 2. **Healthcare Collaboration**

* Nurses capture **Pulse shorts** documenting unusual patient events.
* Posts are tagged with the **patient’s record**.
* Doctors review and respond with directions, even if the original nurse is off shift.
* The thread ensures continuity: another nurse on the topic is notified, takes action, and posts a conclusion.
* Creates a private, auditable chain of communication around a patient’s care.

## Future Possibilities

* **Email as Posts**: Incoming emails could be converted into CCME posts for better prioritization.
* **Expanded Tagging**: Richer tag hierarchies for projects, teams, and patient care.
* **Deeper Ozwell Integration**: Smarter policies to help users manage information overload.
